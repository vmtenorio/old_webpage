        <p id="presentation" class="text-white text-justify px-5">Hi! I'm Víctor, a software engineer and a data scientist from Madrid, Spain. I studied Electrical Engineering in Telecommunications and Aerospace Engineering in Air Navigation. Regarding coding and software engineering, I loved all this world since I first stumbled upon it, and I have always been learning new things in my way through this path. This webpage is a proof of it, I learned a lot while developing all its sections, hope you like it <i class="fa fa-smile-o icon-white" ></i>. Another one of my passions is the world of data science and artificial intelligence: I think it is going to change the world we live in. That is why I'm currently studying a Master's Degree and I already have some <a href="#publicationsRef" target="_blank" class="text-white">publications</a> on the topic, mostly about graph neural networks.</p>

          <h2>IAM Consultant</h2>
          <h4>Deloitte | September 2018 - Today</h4>
          <p>
						For more than two years, I have been working at a leading consulting firm, Deloitte, working in the Identity and Access Management department (IAM). During this time, I had worked on both implementation and operation projects, involving leading technologies in IAM and Privileged Access Management (PAM) fields, such as Sailpoint, CyberArk, BeyondTrust or Thycotic. During this years, my role in the team evolved from just helping out my colleagues in their projects while learning from them into becoming the lead of some of the projects, organizing the work, managing the relationship with the client and coordinating a team of co-workers to complete the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						It also involved development work: Sailpoint tool is mostly configured using Java code, so in all the projects around this tool the job involved code development, working with large codebases, big teams and obviously version control tools. Another example of this kind of tasks is the development of a role mining algorithm from scratch, first of all in Java and then migrated to Python, using the pandas package for data processing.

          <p>From March until September in 2018, I participated in the Talentum internship in Telefonica, working in the Home Access Network department. The job involved two different types of tasks: testing the latest software and hardware versions of the Home Gateway Units (HGU) and network amplifiers (Baseports) that Telefonica delivers to its clients and testing new standards in the fields of xDSL and optical fiber. Top results in the market were achieved, with traffic of more than 8.5 Gbps in a single device that was prepared to use one of these optical fiber standards (NGPON-2).</p>

          <p>During the summer of 2017, I went to Linköping, in Sweden, to participate in an Internship in the Linköping University with the Erasmus+ program. During this time, I worked on a project where we extracted information from a UAV with the Pixhawk controller. To gather, process and store the information, the Pixhawk controller was attached to a Raspberry Pi. In the Pixhawk, the Ardupilot code library was loaded. My job involved modifying the configuration of the Pixhawk and the underlying code to gather the required information and storing it in the Raspberry Pi. The modified code is available in <a href="https://github.com/vmtenorio/Ardupilot"> this link</a>.</p>

          <h2>Double Degree in Aerospace Engineering and Electrical Engineering in Telecommunications</h2>
          <h4>King Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain | 2013 - 2018</h4>
          <p>From September 2013 until May 2018, I studied a double degree in aerospace engineering in air navigation and electrical engineering in telecommunications. The election of this degree was because these two fields, being completely different, are really attractive to me. In these 5 years that the degree lasted, I learned concepts from very different topics, ranging from programming, signal processing, radiation and propagation, networks, internet architecture, protocols, etc. in the telecommunications side, to estructures, optimization, flight mechanics, aerodynamics, etc. in the aerospace side. The degree not only provided me with technical knowledge, but it made me a more mature and organized person. During this time, I obtained 54 ECTS with highest honours, and got the excellence scholarship twice.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Python</h3>
        <p>During my first year at university, I already learnt to code in a language called Picky. I really liked it, and that summer, I went on to learn the most popular programming language at that moment, Python. Since then, I have been using it almost for everything, mostly for every task that I see I could automate. That first summer, I coded some games using the Pygame library, that, unfortunately, got lost, but some other projects I made using this language are available in <a href="https://github.com/vmtenorio">my GitHub page</a>. The most remarkable ones not related to machine learning, which I will describe more in detail in the respective sections, are <a href="https://github.com/vmtenorio/X-Serv-Practica-Aparcamientos">a webpage I built using Django framework</a> (with a YouTube video in Spanish about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bcaKTm0-yI">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUWtsMyE6CA">here</a>), or a simple program to make the computer shutdown after a pre-specified time in a day, that worked even with computer shutdowns in between. I also had to use Python during my job at Deloitte, developing a custom role mining and Data Quality algorithm.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Programming</h3>
        <p>Not only Python, but I have also programmed in several other languages: during my university years, I had subjects that showed me other programming languages such as C, Java, Ada, Matlab or Assembly. Also, I learned by myself other languages like Go, C++ during my internship at Linköping, and a bit of Javascript while doing this webpage. Also, during my job at Deloitte, some of the projects involved development work: from a Role Mining project developed in Java at first and then migrated to Python, using Powershell for automated report generations, to work with an international team with more than 10 people in a code library for the Sailpoint IAM tool, that works over Java code, using version control (git and BitBucket) and CI/CD tools (Jenkins).</p>

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Unix / Linux</h3>
        <p>When I started my university degree, I installed Linux on my computer because I needed it for the programming language that my professors created. Since then, I have never come back, and today Linux is installed in my main computer. I have tried several distributions, like Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint or Ubuntu. I really like managing everything using the terminal (the code for this webpage is written using vim) and the simplicity of, for example, installing a new piece of software by just executing a command. Not only at a user level, but also I feel confortable managing Linux environments: for example, during one of my projects at Deloitte I had to install Sailpoint tool in a Linux server (RHEL), which is installed over tomcat, which involved creating and managing a service, managing file permissions, installing SSL certificates in the server, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title text-center">Machine Learning & Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>I started my Bachelor thesis in the Graph Signal Processing world and, when my advisor told me if I wanted to do the thesis in Machine Learning over graphs, that involved programming, I didn't hesitated. Therefore I started learning about Machine Learning and Neural Networks. In the end, my Bachelor Thesis for the electrical engineering was a new type of neural networks over graphs where the input and the output were graph signals defined over different graphs (the code for the simulations is available <a href="https://www.github.com/vmtenorio/GIGOArchitecture">here</a>). Also, my bachelor thesis for the aerospace engineering degree was about using machine learning to predict air traffic delays (code available <a href="https://www.github.com/sergiorozada12/aero-graph">here</a>). Since I was introduced to the Machine Learning world, I have been passionate about it, and that is why I'm currently studying a <a href="http://www.uimp.es/postgrado/estudios/fichaestudio.php?plan=P04C&any=2019-20&verasi=N&lan=en#">Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Research, in the International University Menéndez Pelayo</a>.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned in the Machine Learning skill section, both my bachelor thesis projects were about using machine learning to predict either a signal over a graph or air traffic delays. One of the algorithms used in both projects was a couple of variations of a custom Graph Neural Network architecture, and they were created, trained and evaluated using PyTorch. For more information, refer to the code repositories for them, <a href="https://www.github.com/vmtenorio/GIGOArchitecture">here</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/sergiorozada12/aero-graph">here</a>. The utilization of PyTorch involved the creation of the logic needed to implement the models, training them using mini-batch methods and early stopping (manually implemented) and evaluation of them.</p>

        <p>In the other big machine learning library along with PyTorch, TensorFlow, I also have some experience in developing not only simple networks, but also custom ones, with the process of creating the graph, the session, and running it for the creation of our custom architectures of graph neural networks (initially built in TensorFlow, but in the end migrated to PyTorch). I also worked with the data visualization utilities that TensorBoard offers, so I know the library and the possibilities it can offer.</p>

        <p>In the case of Keras, it is my default option for basic neural networks (i.e. when I don't need to implement an architecture on my own). It is simple, and it allows me to build, train and evaluate built-in neural networks with a few lines of code. That is why the simple neural networks of my <a href="https://www.github.com/sergiorozada12/aero-graph">delay prediction project</a>, as well as the LSTM networks, were built using this library, and implemented using an ADAM optimizer and early stopping.</p>

        <p>I started using pandas in a course of data analysis in my university and, since then, it has been my default tool to process and obtain more information from data. Whether it is in my daily job or in my personal projects, pandas allows me to quickly and easily analyze the data and obtain more information about it. In the first case, my job, I used pandas in a Role Mining and Data Quality project: the information came in the form of CSV files with all the unprocessed data, and what we did was to implement checks to make sure that the information was consistent and compliant with the company security policies. Also for the role mining part, we needed the data in a certain format, and that was easily achieved using pandas. The case of the <a href="https://www.github.com/sergiorozada12/aero-graph">delay prediction project</a> was more difficult, as the database used for the flights contained more than 7 million entries, which poses difficulties in storing the data (the memory of the computer was not able to handle some operations, and we needed to downcast some of the columns) and processing it (some operations required some minutes or even hours to complete, what, without pandas, would have taken days), but thanks to pandas, we were able to achieve it.</p>

        <p>My job in Deloitte was in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) department, and all my projects were directly or indirectly related to identities and their lifecycle. Regarding the IAM tools of the market, I have used Sailpoint, for which I took part in an international project for its installation and configuration, and another one for its operation, so I'm deeply aware of its architecture and way of working. I also used One Identity, for which I'm a certified Implementation Engineer.</p>

In the end, I did more PAM projects than IAM projects, involving implementation work for tools like CyberArk (for which I am a certified Defender and Sentry), BeyondTrust or Thycotic. I have a deep understanding of how privileged accounts should be managed, how the structure for them should be and what are the best practices to keep the infrastructure safe. Also in some of these projects in my senior years, I was in the lead of the implementation team, which also grants me leadership and management skills.</p>

              Neural networks (NNs) and graph signal processing have emerged as important actors in data-science applications dealing with complex (non-linear, non-Euclidean) datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-aware NN architecture to learn the mapping between graph signals that are defined on two different graph datasets. The novel proposed architecture is based on two NNs and a common latent space. In particular, we consider an underparametrized graph-aware NN encoder that maps the input graph signal to a latent space, followed by an underparametrized graph-aware NN decoder which maps the latent representation to the output graph signal. The parameters of the two NN are jointly learned by using a training set and the back-propagation algorithm. The resulting architecture can then be viewed as an underparametrized graph-aware encoder/decoder NN operating over two different graphs. The proposed scheme outperforms the corresponding benchmark NN architectures in the literature.

              There is a growing interest in the joint application of graph signal processing and neural networks (NNs) for learning problems involving complex, non-linear and/or non-Euclidean datasets. This paper proposes an overparametrized graph-aware NN architecture able to represent a non-linear mapping between two graph signals, each defined on a different graph. The considered architecture is based on two NNs and a common latent space. Specifically, we consider an overparametrized graph-aware NN encoder which maps the input graph signal to a latent space, followed by an overparametrized graph-aware NN decoder that transforms the latent representation to the output graph signal. The parameters of the two NNs are jointly tuned by applying the back-propagation algorithm with an early stopping procedure to prevent overfitting. The overall architecture can be interpreted as an overparametrized graph-aware encoder/decoder NN operating over two different graphs. A key element in the encoder (decoding) scheme is the consideration of a nested collection of parametric graph-aware (down-) up-sampling operators, whose design will be studied in detail. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed scheme outperforms the corresponding benchmark NN architectures, previously introduced in the literature.
